Personal Project

My Satallite Tracker project is a personal portfolio project for satelite traking in real-time using Two-Line Element set (TLE) data. It gets TLE data from [CelesTrak](https://celestrak.org/) and uses **satellite.js** and **CesiumJS** for 3D visualizations. 

*Planned Features*
- Pull and store satellite TLE
- Show a 3-D globe with real-time visualizations
- Predict next satellite passover a certain location
- Search for satelities in space

*Tech Stack*
- Frontend: HTML/Javascript + CesiumJS, satellite.js
- Backend: Java
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Data Sources: CelesTrak, NASA APIs, SpaceX API

*Goals*
- Build data dashboard software to develop skills in handling data
- Learn APIs, databases, and cloud deployment
- Get practice on working with Astro-tech software using resorces from NASA and SpaceX to showcase my interest in Astronomical Technology

*Demo* 
- COMING SOON
